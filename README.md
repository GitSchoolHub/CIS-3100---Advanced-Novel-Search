## ✨ Project Overview: Solving Novel Discoverability

This project presents the full architectural plan, business strategy, and a working UI/UX wireframe for a comprehensive **Advanced Novel Search Engine Finder**. The core motivation is to combat the pervasive problem of inaccurate and unstructured tagging across major web novel platforms.

The solution focuses on implementing an advanced, AI-powered, structured tagging system (conceptualized to use a service like Gemini) to dramatically improve book discovery for readers.
