# 🔍 Advanced Novel Search Engine Finder Project

## ✨ Project Overview

This repository contains the full documentation and a working UI/UX wireframe for a proposed **Advanced Novel Search Engine Finder**. The project aims to solve the problem of poor book discoverability and inaccurate tagging systems prevalent across existing web novel and book cataloging sites, as detailed in the **Business Model**.

The core solution is an advanced search interface and a defined business/product strategy for implementing a comprehensive, structured tagging system.
