# 🔍 Advanced Novel Search Engine Finder Project

## ✨ Project Overview

This repository contains the full documentation and a working UI/UX wireframe for a proposed **Advanced Novel Search Engine Finder**. The project aims to solve the problem of poor book discoverability and inaccurate tagging systems prevalent across existing web novel and book cataloging sites.

The core solution is an advanced search interface and a defined business/product strategy for implementing a comprehensive, structured tagging system.
